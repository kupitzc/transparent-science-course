<h4 id="week-3.-preregistration-and-open-science-vandekerckhove">Week 3. <strong>Preregistration and Open Science</strong> (Vandekerckhove)</h4>
<p>There are many little decisions that people must make in performing research. These decisions are often made quickly, sometimes without much thought, and sometimes without awareness that a decision has been made. To the extent that these little decisions tend to go in a preferred direction, they may be thought of as subtle biases. Preregistration helps bring these decisions into the light where they may be critically examined. In-class discussion will focus on the limitations of preregistration. Is it ever not useful? Is it ever not possible? Is it ever damaging?</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="week-4.-expanding-the-document-vandekerckhove">Week 4. <strong>Expanding The Document</strong> (Vandekerckhove)</h4>
<p>The traditional document has been thought of as output. We find that sometimes people do not write what they do. Here we stress the concept of a document as a process. Documents are executed much like a program, and when they are, data are pulled, analyses are performed, graphs are drawn, tables are tabulated, and equations are typeset. The process of all these things is encoded in the document.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Write</strong> --- <em>Powered by the cloud.</em> --- Place some data on OSF. Write an Rmd, Swv, or similar document that pulls data from OSF and produces some output for them that is integrated into a text. The exact analysis or text are not important.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="week-5.-versioning-git-push-rouder">Week 5. <strong>Versioning: git push</strong> (Rouder)</h4>
<p>Every lab encounters the clutter of having multiple, evolving versions of work products. How do you deal with versioning? We present different version strategies including the gold standard --- git.</p>
<h4 id="week-6.-working-with-collaborators-vandekerckhove">Week 6. <strong>Working With Collaborators</strong> (Vandekerckhove)</h4>
<p>Working with collaborators is hard because they change our awesome text. How do you work constructively, productively, and mistake free with people you kind of resent having to talk to? What makes an interesting collaboration?</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="week-7.-computational-lab-skills-linuxsqlpythonbash-vandekerckhove">Week 7. <strong>Computational Lab Skills: Linux/SQL/Python/Bash</strong> (Vandekerckhove)</h4>
<p>Computers don't make mistakes; people do. So never ask a person to do a dumb, repetitive task when a computer can do it better! This lecture is about working with scripts to automate tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Write</strong> --- <em>GUIs? We don't need no stinkin' GUIs!</em> --- Write a script to pull your paper off Overleaf, add the current time and date, render it to PDF, and upload the finished file to OSF and back to Overleaf.</li>
